# My Choices
## README.md
I decided to include a README as I understand it to be good practice to include one, and I want to make sure that I get used to including them in projects for the future
## License
I decided to use an MIT license as I enjoy its simplicity. I feel no need to use any tighter license, and the most important part to me, attribution, is included.
